int main()

    //assignment operator
 //int a=20;
 //a*=5;
 //printf("%d",a);
 //output is 100 and all the arithematic operator will work same


 //Bitwise operator left shift
 //int a=5;
 //a=a<<2;
 //printf("%d",a);
 //output is 20 because of number 5 is store in memory in the form of binary
 

//Bitwise operator right shift
//int a=5,b;
 //b=a>>2;
 //printf("%d %d",a,b);
 //output is 5 1 


//Bitwise XOR operator
// int a=5^3;
 //printf("%d",a);
 //output is 6


 //Bitwise OR operator
 //int a=5|3;
 //printf("%d",a);
 //output is 7


 //Bitwise AND operator
 //int a=5&3;
 //printf("%d",a);  //output is 1


 //Bitwise complement
 //int a=~5;
 //printf("%d",a);   //output is -6 ,that is the output is 2's complement


int a=~(-5);
printf("%d",a);  //output is 4 ,that is complement of 2's complement
